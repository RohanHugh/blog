title: Setting up this blog
---
As dissapointing to myself as this is to say, I struggled quite a bit to setup this blog. I've wanted to setup a blog for many months now, but I've kept on running into problems which put me off setting it up, in this post I'll explain why it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be, the challenges I faced, how I solved them and my thought process around it.
