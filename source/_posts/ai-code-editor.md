## Introduction

If this post doesn't go out of date or relevance in 3 mins you get a free cookie. With this area rapidly changing and updating it's hard to stay on top and takes time on what's the best most up to date models, although whether this is nessccary or not is a whole topic in itself. I'll be recommending some good AI Code editors. I would recommend one universal editor but everyones got different use cases so that doesn't really apply here. However there are 100% ones that are way better or do things that the others don't that you might find useful. 

### Roo Code / Cline

This one is probably my favourite.
