## Introduction

If this post doesn't go out of date or relevance in 3 mins you get a free cookie. With this area rapidly changing and updating it's hard to stay on top and takes time on what's the best most up to date models, although whether this is nessccary or not is a whole topic in itself. I'll be recommending some good AI Code editors. I would recommend one universal editor but everyones got different use cases so that doesn't really apply here. However there are 100% ones that are way better or do things that the others don't that you might find useful. Currently AI Code Editors tend to use a ton of tokens for LLM's [A Guide to LLMs](/2025/02/11/a-guide-to-llms/) which could potentially get very costly depending on what model you are running and whether you are running it locally or not.

### RooCode / Cline

This one is probably my favourite. Roo Code is a fork of Cline, with various added features and updates over Cline, however isn't as stable as Cline. It's open source, allows for Ollama integration really easily so you can run coding models locally. Also supports many different API providers, my favourite being [Openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)

### Cursor

### Codeium

### Github Copilot
