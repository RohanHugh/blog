title: 3x Your Browsing Speed on Keyboard with Vimium
---
A couple of months ago a friend of mine showed me Vimium, it's basically [vim](https://www.vim.org/) supported for the browser. I am still fairly new to vim as it is, but being able to browse the web through the keyboard has made it so much faster and less effort. I mainly use 3 to 4 main types of actions, here are the keys I use mostly:

>**F** - Shows options to navigate anywhere on page

>**J,K** - Scroll up or down the page
>
>**D,U** - Faster scroll than J and K
>
>**Shift + J, Shift + K** - Switch left and right between tabs
>
>**Shift + G, GG** - Scroll to bottom or top of page
>
My only bug bear with it is that it can sometimes get stuck on pages for weird reasons, at some point I will fix this and then it'll be perfect.
