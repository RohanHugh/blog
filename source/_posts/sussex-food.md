As of writing this, food on campus is quite expensive, for example ... . And sometimes you may not have the time to make food and be forced to purchase on campus. So, I found a combo to have breakfast and lunch for only £6 with good macros which I will be listed below.

The first place is co-op. You can get one of the wraps, my favourite is the Mexican Chili Cheese *I need to double check this*. Then one of the pastries, I like to go with the steak. Then finishing with a drink, I like go to with one of the lipton drinks. This equates to £4. Which is a steal in my opinion, it's like £8 worth of food and drink. With the wrap costing £3.30.

The next place is Eat Central, which is right next to the co-op, they do meals there for £2 - £3.50 between 12pm - 3pm every weekday. I like to go with the £2 option as I feel like the other option isn't usually worth it for the price difference. But I have the option to treat myself if I want which I very rarely do.
