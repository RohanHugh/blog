title: Skript - The Perfect Coding Language for Kids
---
## Introduction

What is Skript? Skript is just a coding language to help make minecraft 'plugins' know as scripts, which are stored in the scripts folder. The language is a mix of english and procedual concepts so anyone can pick it up, it was my first coding language at ~13, for example, say if I wanted to give the player a diamond when they right click the code would be as follows:
```skript
on right click:
    give player 1 diamond
```
Super easy right? There's not really much to it. And then from there you would save the file inside the scripts folder as a .sk and then do

>/sk reload *script name*

to reload the changes, you can also write it without the Java interpreter which makes it super accessible, you can just use a notepad if you wanted (Although not recommended of course)

Any error messages are then broadcasted to you either in-game or in the console, depending on where you executed the command

The error messages are usually much easier to read than something compared to Java, they tend to point out your mistakes in skript better

## Why Skript?

Well. As a kid I wanted to learn how to code, with trying to self teach at 13 to make Java plugins it was just too difficult (especially without AI at the time, would've been a lifesaver back then) many hours on waiting on responses on why something won't work. I would need to understand OOP which I barely knew what a variable was back then.

It also has really [good documentation](https://skripthub.net/docs/) if you get stuck anywhere. And there are many tutorials out there to help increase your knowledge and understanding. There's also the SkUnity discord where you can usually get a response for support in *~30 seconds to 3 mins*.

Another reason why I think it's so good is that **it's actually fun and enjoyable** due to it's ease of use and huge potential to make what you want. It lets your creativity run free while learning basic programming concepts like variables, arrays, functions and loops.

You can also use the power of Java in it with something called [Skript-Reflect](https://github.com/SkriptLang/skript-reflect) so if you were daring you had that option. Although from what I've heard it's not perfect, but still extremely good.

## Downsides

Without a doubt it could start to form bad practices and habbits which is what people tend to argue against it and teaching something like Python which has an easier learning curve than Java. But here's the thing, kids will listen to what you have to say, but they also want to have fun, I experienced this first hand when I went to my first coding club at 14, we attempted to learn Java with Android Studio. It was awful, most people didn't care and weren't interested in making a calculator app or some other boring ass app. Everyone loves Minecraft. Make it fun, which is what skript does, and it becomes much easier. Taken from experience, eventually you should transition out of it.

Some of bad practices include the way their arrays works and other concepts, sometimes they're not typically of a procedual programming language, for example their arrays tend to be quite strange, and trying to do anything outside a regular single array tends to be quite difficult from recall, this may have changed however since it's been many years.

## Conclusion

Overall I could see Skript as a language to help kids kickstart their coding career. I think this should be used everywhere instead of other coding languages, unless you were to think the kid were to be competent enough for that, but most tend not to be.
