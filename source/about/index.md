title: About Me
---

I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building great products. I have experience in a variety of technologies, including software development and machine learning. I started coding in [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) when I was 12-13 years old. From there I didn't look back and have loved computers ever since. My Computer Science Resume can be found [here.](https://www.rohan.je/rohan-hugh-cs-resume.pdf)

I'm also a video editor, having edited for many YouTubers with 100,000+ Subscribers, I assisted them in generating thousands in ad-revenue and other sources of income by taking their content to the next level. I started editing Minecraft videos for [my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@83yWasTooShort/videos) in 2018 with Filmora on some terrible laptop with 4gb of RAM, from there as I made money from editing jobs, I leveled up my setup and started using Premiere Pro and After Effects in around 2020 and now have over 5+ years of experience with them, as well as other Adobe Products. My Video Editing Resume can be found here (WIP).

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. If you are interested in working with me, or have any questions, please contact me at <span class="copy-text" data-copy="rohanhugh1@gmail.com">rohanhugh1@gmail.com</span> *(Click to copy to clipboard)*.
